✿ Task: Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II

❖ Problem Statement: The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform an array such that at least one element is equal to or greater than the target value. If it is not possible, return -1.

★ Steps:
    1.Input: 
        ❖ You start with a list of integers nums and an integer target: 
            ※ nums: 
                ● The list of integers to be modified. 
            ※ target: 
                ● The value that at least one element in the list must reach.

    2.Initialization: 
        ❖ Define a method min_operations within a class Solution. 
        ❖ Initialize left_pointer, current_pointer, and operation_count to 0.

    3.Process: 
        ❖ Sort the list nums. 
        ❖ Iterate until the condition is met: 
            ※ Find First Smallest: 
                ● Compare elements to find the smallest element and increment pointers accordingly. 
            ※ Check Against Target: 
                ● If the smallest element is greater than or equal to the target, return the operation count. 
            ※ Find Second Smallest: 
                ● Find the next smallest element similarly. 
            ※ Perform Operation: 
                ● Replace an element with 2 * first_smallest + second_smallest. 
                ● Increment the operation count.

    4.Output: 
        ❖ If the condition is met, return the operation count. 
        ❖ If it is not possible to reach the target, return -1
